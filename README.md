# hello-world
Just another repository 
I am Wan Chang. I did a terrible thing today. I was feeling guity when I did this. It all started when my teammates ask me about some simple questions about the code. This is when I felt that its my fault, taking away all their opportunities to learn and caused the ending up like this. I went to our whatapps group and apologized but it turn out worst. This is because I din think through properly and used terrible sentences.This is what I said..."I am sorry that I did everything. I will make sure that you guys understand everything next time". I am stupid to say that I DID EVERYTHING. But the true facts is that I dont let them do D: What should I do, I may hurt their feelings as they always try their best to help me out. Furthermore, they did put alot of effort in this Assigment too. I will go and apologize to them one by one. This misunderstanding will definitely brings negative effects to my group. I dont want them to feel bad about me :( Sorry guys.
